       Hello! My name is John. Over the last twelve years, I've delivered an aggregate of nearly a billion dollars in work product and services for teams ranging from early-stage startups to Fortune 500 companies in aerospace, energy, and healthcare.
     </pr>
     <p>
       I believe in people, teams, and organizations; I've witnessed nothing is impossible with the right people in your corner, and having successfully led programs, products, and operations to identify and implement--what is the RIGHT solution for the customer--I'd be remiss to not recognize the most humbling individuals I've had the pleasure of sharing the trenches with to solve some of our world's most daunting technical problems.
     </p>
     <p>
       I've launched geostationary spacecraft to provide broadband internet to various parts of the world; I've managed and delivered digital health products into the hands of ophthalmology patients across multiple countries during the global pandemic; I fought the good fight in DC to provide the launcher's perspective on the ever-evolving rocket launch regulations for the NewSpace and SmallSat communities.
     </p>
     <p>
       I'm always looking for the next great team to tackle the next big problem. Please feel free to send me a message for a coffee, a bike ride, a walk--let's see what we can solve together.
     </p>
